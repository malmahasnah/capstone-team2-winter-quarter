To set up the required conda environment,
1. Create a new anaconda environment with >conda create --name `<name>`
2. Run >pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run >python3 run.py, with either fisherz or chisq as the argument to notate which algorithm should be used to generate the graph

To run the FCI with KCI or "fast KCI" algorithm:
1. Run >pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run >python3 FCI-fastKCI.py

**TODO, adjust instructions for (potentially) Fast KCI + normal KCI
